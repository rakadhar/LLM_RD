    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

       "\n",
       "The **Five-Star Quality Rating System** was developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to assist consumers, families, and caregivers in comparing nursing homes. It allows users to evaluate the quality of nursing homes based on a star rating system ranging from 1 to 5 stars, where 5 stars indicate much above average quality and 1 star indicates much below average quality. Ratings are provided for overall quality as well as for health inspections, staffing, and quality measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Key Features:\n",
       "- **Overall Rating**: A single star rating reflecting the overall quality of each nursing home.\n",
       "- **Separate Ratings**: Additional ratings for health inspections, staffing levels, and quality measures.\n",
       "- Users are encouraged to utilize the rating system alongside other information sources, including personal visits to nursing homes.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recent Updates:\n",
       "- **January 18, 2023**: CMS announced adjustments to quality measure ratings based on erroneous schizophrenia coding, with audits planned for facilities that may have inaccuracies in their Minimum Data Set data.\n",
       "- **January 7, 2022**: New measures for nursing staff turnover and weekend staffing levels were added to the Care Compare website, set to impact the Five-Star Quality Rating System.\n",
       "- **December 4, 2020**: Announced updates to the Rating System, including resumption of health inspection and quality measure calculations starting January 27, 2021.\n",
       "\n",
       "For more detailed guidance, including the methods used to calculate these ratings, users can refer to the **Five-Star Quality Rating System Technical Users' Guide** and visit the **Nursing Home Care Compare** website for comparisons of nursing homes in their area."

The process uses equations to determine expected scores based on whether residents trigger specific covariates, such as bowel incontinence and pressure ulcers. The example given calculates expected scores for a QM related to catheter use, demonstrating the effect of resident conditions on expected outcomes. The facility-level expected QM score is derived by averaging the resident-level scores for the QMs....\n",

      "  Section 4: Calculation of the Adjusted QM Score:\n",
      "  The text outlines the process for calculating the risk-adjusted QM score, which is a measurement adjusted for facility-specific risks in nursing facilities. This score estimates a facility's QM rate assuming its residents have average risk. The calculation involves the facility-level observed QM score, the facility-level average expected QM score, and the national average observed QM score. A specific formula using natural logarithms adjusts these scores. Special cases in the equation are addressed when the observed QM rate equals 0.00 or 1.00. The adjusted QM scores range from 0 to 1 and can be converted to percentages for easier interpretation. The process applies to QMs using expected scores based on resident-level covariates, with necessary data available in the Risk-Adjustment Appendix File....\n",

      "  Section 5: Risk-Adjustment Appendix Overview:\n",
      "  The Risk-Adjustment Appendix Overview provides details on the intercept and logistic regression coefficient values used in risk-adjusted quality measures (QMs). These are available in the Risk-Adjustment Appendix File on the NHQI website, containing current and historical values and the risk-adjustment schedule with applicable discharge dates. The Excel worksheets in the Appendix File include an overview, the risk-adjustment schedule, full and abbreviated measure names, update IDs, manual specification versions, posting dates, and assessment dates for each update. The National Average tab shows observed scores for each update, noting that national averages in public reports may differ.

       "\n",
       "1. **Absence of Trust**: Team members' fear of vulnerability prevents the establishment of trust.\n",
       "2. **Fear of Conflict**: Hesitance to engage in healthy debate leads to unproductive meetings and decisions.\n",
       "3. **Lack of Commitment**: When team members are not aligned on goals, it causes indecision and a lack of direction.\n",
       "4. **Avoidance of Accountability**: Without clear commitments, team members hesitate to hold each other accountable for their contributions.\n",
       "5. **Inattention to Results**: Focusing on personal goals over team outcomes detracts from collective success.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Insights**: The text emphasizes that all teams can be dysfunctional to some extent, but with courage and discipline, these dysfunctions can be addressed. Functional teams result in better productivity, decision-making, and employee retention.\n",
